# Character-Editor
This is a font editor for 8-bit style computers. 

Fonts are stored in a 1 byte per row format. Each row is 8 pixels wide, and 
each bit in the row represents one pixel. The high bit is the left pixel, and 
the low bit is the right pixel.

The editor can handle character cell sizes from 8 to 16 bytes per cell. 

Guides are available to help set the character top, baseline, and bottom.

I'd love a heads-up when forking this or using it in your project.
